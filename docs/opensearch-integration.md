# OpenSearch Integration Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use Chrome address bar search integration for your internal Ecton network.

## üéØ Overview

OpenSearch is a web standard that allows websites to describe their search functionality to browsers. Once configured, users can search your internal network directly from Chrome's address bar, providing a seamless search experience similar to Google.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Chrome automatically detects the OpenSearch descriptor when visiting your site
2. **Integration**: Users can add Ecton Search as a search engine in Chrome
3. **Usage**: Type a keyword in the address bar, press Tab, enter query, press Enter
4. **Results**: Instantly redirected to search results from your internal systems

## üìã Setup Instructions

### For System Administrators

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Next.js application running on your internal network
- Meilisearch instance running (localhost:7700 or custom host)
- SSL certificate (recommended for production)

#### 2. Environment Configuration

Create or update your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEILISEARCH_URL=http://localhost:7700
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY=your_search_key_here
```

#### 3. Initialize Search Data

Run the initialization endpoint to set up sample data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/meilisearch/init
```

#### 4. Verify Installation

Test the OpenSearch endpoints:

```bash
# Test XML descriptor
curl http://your-domain.com/opensearch.xml

# Test search endpoint
curl "http://your-domain.com/api/opensearch/search?q=portal"

# Test suggestions
curl "http://your-domain.com/api/opensearch/suggestions?q=emp"
```
